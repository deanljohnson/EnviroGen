EnviroGen is a WIP environment generator that can quickly generate large 2d height maps. Currently, these environments are generated using noise algorithms such as Simplex Noise. The height maps can be modified with simple modifiers such as addition, scaling, or normalization, or physical processes such as erosion.

The EnviroGen Display project in the source code gives an easy to use node based editor that allows you to quickly apply modifiers to an environment and see the results.

EnviroGen's goal is to produce whole simulated environments: terrain, oceans, weather, tectonics, vegetation, animals, and more. This is a large project and is unlikely to be finished soon. Currently, terrain can be generated and colored based on height. Two erosion processes (thermal and hydraulic) can be ran, but they are ran at generation time, not as an active simulation.
